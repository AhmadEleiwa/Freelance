Freelance is a free-space hosting website built using MERN stack.  The site allow you to upload your projects (products) in the site.  You can also access the other products. You can put like to them or to buy it. The site has a authentication system. 

We used MERN stack in this project becouse the flexablity of js  and the power of Node.js. With react is esaily to build an interactive website. 

The most problem that faced us is that in  authentication. It have to check whatever the                email is exist or not. So, we had to use google api to send a code to the email that was formed. Then after that, the frontend have to wait untill insert the genrate code that was sended
